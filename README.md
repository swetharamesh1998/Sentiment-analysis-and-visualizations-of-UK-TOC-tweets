•	Dissertation: Sentiment Analysis of UK Train Services Using Twitter Data  
•	Implemented a project analyzing public sentiments toward UK Train Operating Companies (TOCs) using Twitter, employing NLP and machine learning techniques. 
•	Leveraged advanced tools and methods including Python (twscrape, WordCloud), Tableau, Flourish; Algorithms and Accuracy : Naïve Bayes (74.30%), Logistic Regression (76.32%), SVM (76.1%), GBM (71.4%), Random Forest(74.53%) and Decision Tree (67.2%). The comparison showed that Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest are the best performers.
•	Established that  Logistic Regression leads with an accuracy of 76.32%, followed by SVM at 76.17%, with both models doing equally well across precision, recall, and F1-score criteria. 
•	Created data visualizations (word clouds, regional sentiment maps) using Python, Tableau and Flourish to interpret sentiment trends effectively.
•	Conducted a user evaluation study to assess the visualization effectiveness, informing decision-making processes for TOCs and policy-makers
